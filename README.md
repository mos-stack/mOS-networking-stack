# mOS-networking-stack

mOS networking stack provides a high performance user-space programming library
specifically targeted for building software-based stateful monitoring solutions.
Our API offers powerful event-based abstractions that can potentially simplify the
codebase of future middleboxes that are developed on our stack.

We suggest you to browse through our example (```samples/```) programs to
see how stateful middleboxes can be built using the mOS networking API.

To download our source, type:

```
# git clone https://github.com/ndsl-kaist/mOS-networking-stack.git
```

Pull requests and bug fixes are welcomed!
